# [Exporting an OpenAI Gym simulation to a video](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-export-the-run-to-a-video-file)
You will have to install FFmpeg to save the simulation to a video. You can install it on [Windows](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) by downloading the executable and placing it inside the same folder as the python script. You can install it on OS X via `brew install ffmpeg`. You can install it on most Debian variants via `sudo apt install libav-tools`. You can install it on most Arch variants via `sudo pacman -S ffmpeg`.
